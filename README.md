#### Description of the project.

The project is intended for users to post messages in a decentralized system.
Creation and deletion of data is associated with a change in the balance of `PAGE` tokens and `NFT` tokens `PAGE` on users' wallets
Users can join communities. Community - a group of users united by some common interests.

Communities are created first. Each community can create their own posts and comments on posts.
Creating a post automatically entails the creation of a `NFT` token. Every post and comment has a wallet address
user - the creator and the wallet address of the user - owner. `NFT` tokens (posts) can be transferred
from one user to another. But giving `NFT` to someone just isn't possible.
It is possible provided that the user - the recipient of the `NFT` token before accepting the token gave approve() for this operation.
